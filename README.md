# Save The World Game
Daphne Bavelier, the client, is a brain scientist, who is inclined in learning how the brain functions and wants to create a way for the brain to get smarter, faster, and overall, better. She sincerely feels that video games are the key to unlocking our brains potential. Therefore, she wants to create several games that explore the ideas that attract and stimulate the brain’s capacity to think. These games will run on easily-available computers. The target audience of this experiment are human beings of all ages. Parents believe that whenever their children play video games, it is a waste of valuable time. The results from Bavelier’s experiments show otherwise. Playing video games have many beneficial effects to children. Enhanced vision and greater focus are just some of these examples. The problem that Bavelier’s team faces is that, “what we need is really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolate that is irresistible, that you really want to play, but that has all the ingredients, the good ingredients that are extracted from the broccoli that you can&#39;t recognize but are still working on your brains.” 1 The broccoli in this context represents education games whereas the chocolate represents games that children prefer to play. The challenge for Bavelier and her fellow scientists is to create an educative game which excites and engages children. This will in turn, enhance the minds of future generations
